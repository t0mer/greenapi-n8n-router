‚úÖ YAML-based configuration with live reload support

‚úÖ Routes messages to different n8n webhooks based on chatId

‚úÖ Async forwarding using httpx

‚úÖ Deployable via Docker Compose or systemd

‚úÖ Structured logging with loguru


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
The app/config.yaml file defines your Green-API credentials and routing rules:
```yaml
green_api:
  instance_id: "your-instance-id"
  token: "your-api-token"

routes:
  1234567890@c.us: "https://n8n.local/webhook/route1"
  9876543210@c.us: "https://n8n.local/webhook/route2"
```

üõ°Ô∏è On first run, the app will auto-create this file if it doesn't exist.

## üöÄ Deployment Options


### Option 1: Docker Compose

Create the following docker-compose.yaml file:

```yaml
services:
  greenapi-n8n-router:
    image: techblog/greenapi-n8n-router
    container_name: greenapi-n8n-router
    volumes:
      - ./app/config/:/app/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Run the container using Docker Compose:

```bash 
docker-compose up -d
```

Verify the logs:
```bash
docker logs -f greenapi-n8n-router
```

### Option 2: systemd Service

clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/t0mer/greenapi-n8n-router
```

Then enter the application folder:
```bash
cd greenapi-n8n-router
```

and run pip command to install the dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


Create a systemd service file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/greenapi-n8n-router.service
```

Add the following content:

```bash

[Unit]
Description=GreenAPI to n8n Router
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/greenapi-n8n-router
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 app/main.py
Restart=on-failure
User=your-username

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Replace /path/to/greenapi-n8n-router with the actual path to your project directory.

Reload systemd and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable greenapi-n8n-router
sudo systemctl start greenapi-n8n-router
```

Check the service status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status greenapi-n8n-router
```

üß∞ Testing

Set your Green-API webhook URL to point to this service.
Send a WhatsApp message from a number listed in your config.yaml routes.
Verify that the message is forwarded to the corresponding n8n webhook URL.
